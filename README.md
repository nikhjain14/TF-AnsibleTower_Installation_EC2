# TF-AnsibleTower_Installation_EC2
Hi there âœ‹!

We can use this terraform file to create EC2 instance and install latest version of Ansible Tower on AWS(Amazon Web Services) along with security group(with custom rules).


Requirements
------------

To execute this code successfully, we need to install terraform on our system. Please use below commands to install terraform or refer official terraform website.

&nbsp;

**_Terraform installation commands:_**
```
# dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
# dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/fedora/hashicorp.repo
# dnf install -y terraform
```

&nbsp;
>Replace few values in "terraform.tfvars" variable file.
```
ports = [22, 80, 443, 5432, 4369, 15672, 25672]
image_name = "RHEL_HA-8.4.0_HVM-*-x86_64-2-Hourly2-GP2"
instance_type = "t2.xlarge"
region = "us-east-1"
access_key = "Enter_Access_key"
secret_key = "Enter_Secret_key"
vpc_id = "vpc_id"
ansible_tower_tar_URL = "https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz"
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Copy public and private ssh key file(id_rsa.pub & id_rsa).
* [x] Public ssh key will be use to create ssh-key pair and attach with EC2 instance.
* [x] Private ssh key will be use to take ssh on EC2 instance and perform further Ansible Tower installation.

&nbsp;
>To execute terraform code file, please refer below commands.

 ```
$ terraform init                      //To download provider modules
$ terraform validate                  //To check/validate terraform code file
$ terraform plan                      //To check all setting and configuration before apply
$ terraform apply                     //To execute the code on AWS(Amazon Web Service)
```
